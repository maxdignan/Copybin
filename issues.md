# AppDelegate.swift Issues and Improvements

## 1. Memory Management and Performance Issues
- [x] Inefficient shell command execution creating new Process and Pipe objects frequently
- [x] Menu rebuilding from scratch on every update
- [x] No memory management for timer

## 2. Error Handling
- [x] Shell command execution lacks proper error handling
- [x] Clipboard operations don't handle failures
- [x] No error feedback to users

## 3. String Handling
- [x] Potential command injection vulnerability in shell command string interpolation
- [x] No string escaping for shell commands

## 4. Timer Management
- [x] Timer never invalidated
- [x] Too frequent polling (every second)
- [x] No battery life consideration

## 5. UI/UX Issues
- [x] No text truncation for long menu items
- [x] No visual indication of current clipboard item
- [x] Basic menu implementation

## 6. Code Organization
- [x] Violates Single Responsibility Principle
- [x] Mixed concerns (clipboard, UI, shell commands)
- [x] Needs component separation

## 7. Potential Race Conditions
- [x] Unsynchronized clipboard operations
- [x] Unsynchronized menu updates

## 8. Missing Features
- [x] No persistence between launches
- [x] No history clearing mechanism
- [x] No keyboard shortcuts
- [x] No search/filter functionality

## 9. Accessibility
- [x] Missing accessibility labels
- [x] Missing accessibility descriptions

## 10. Modern Swift Practices
- [x] Using shell commands instead of native APIs
- [-] Could use async/await (Removed - maintaining compatibility with macOS 10.12)
- [x] Could use modern string handling 

## 11. Compatibility
- [x] Updated deployment target to macOS 10.12
- [x] Removed async/await in favor of synchronous operations
- [x] Using traditional notification-based clipboard monitoring
